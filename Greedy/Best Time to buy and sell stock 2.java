// leetcode problem 122
//Given an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

//Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
//You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
//Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<prices.length;i++)
            if(prices[i]>prices[i-1])profit+=prices[i]-prices[i-1];
        return profit;
    }
}

// why this works?
// Plot the prices on the graph paper 
//you will find that max profit will be obtained âˆ‘(height(peak_i)-height(valley_i))
