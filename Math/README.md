## Important points about catalan number
1. A convex polygon with n + 2 sides can be cut into triangles by connecting vertices with non-crossing line segments (a form of polygon triangulation). The number of triangles formed is n and the number of different ways that this can be achieved is Cn.
2. Cn is the number of full binary trees with n + 1 leaves
3. Cn is the number of Dyck words of length 2n. A Dyck word is a string consisting of n X's and n Y's such that no initial segment of the string has more Y's than X's.
4. Re-interpreting the symbol X as an open parenthesis and Y as a close parenthesis, Cn counts the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched.
5. Cn is the number of different ways n + 1 factors can be completely parenthesized (or the number of ways of associating n applications of a binary operator).
6. Cn is the number of unique BST which have n nodes from 1 to n.
7. Cn is the number of non-isomorphic ordered trees with n + 1 vertices.
