### Construction of trees

Trees can be constructed from
1) Inorder and preorder
2) Inorder and postorder
3) Inorder and levelorder

Other combinations like preorder and postorder etc cannot be used for construction of trees

NOTE: 
1) Preorder and postorder can generate a FULL binary tree
2) The level order traversal of a binary tree prints the data in the same order as it is stored in the array representation of a complete binary tree.
3) Inorder traversal of BST generates sorted list
