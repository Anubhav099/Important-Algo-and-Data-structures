## Trie
Trie is an efficient data structure used for retrieval of information. \
One of the main application of the trie data structure is when you have to search for a specific string from a large group of words. \

## Advantages
1) With the help of a trie, we can search a word of length 'L' in O(L) time which is way faster than hashing. \
2) Printing all words present in the trie in alphabetical order. \
3) Prefix searching becomes convinient.

## Disadvantage
The Disadvantage is that tries require a lot of memory

One of the main application of tries is the auto completion of a query in the google search bar.
