## DFS vs BFS

1. DFS uses stack to traverse the graph and BFS uses queue to traverse the graph.
2. DFS is used in decision making problems and BFS can be used to find shortest distance in an unweighted graph.
3. Both have same time complexity: O(V+E)
4. BFS is slower than DFS.

#### DO NOT USE DFS TO CALCULATE SHORTEST DISTANCE UNLESS YOU USE DP
